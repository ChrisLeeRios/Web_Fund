    <h1 class="header main-header">He Was A Rapper!?!</h1>
    <p>Indeed I was! My father was a legendary rapper in the 90s named <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Pun">"Big Pun"</a>. As the universe
        would have it, he passed away via heart attack whenI was 6, leaving me the
        only boy with my mother and 2 sisters. Though I was the youngest, I felt
        the responability to provide, and thus, leading me down the path of a rapper. Going
        by the stage name <a href="https://www.chrisriversuniverse.com/">"Chris Rivers"</a>,
        right after highschool I released my first freestyle on youtube <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMiBBV6DH0c">"LYRICAL CATASTROPHY"</a>. Looking
        back now, I cringe at how horrible it was ( like in every way ) but it was the start of something.
        Fast forwarding through out the years, not only did i get better, but i realseased a ton of
        new content and studio albums.

    <p>Just to show a few. I arguably became one of the greatest lyricists on the planet (no cap) but ultimately
        realized
        that I ruined a hobby by turning it into a job. Heres a video of my 2 good friends and I promoting my latest
        album
        by being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU7-0b9r_NM&t=248s">The Greatest Rappers Ever</a>.
        Theres so much that I have done and accomplished, too much to fit here, and even though I am moving on from Hip
        Hop,
        it will always be a part of who I am.

    <h1 class="header">He Found His Soulmate!!!</h1>
    <p>
        Yes after a long life of being the good guy, getting abused and cheated on, minimizing my worth, learning,
        growing, heartbreaks and an epic thot phase, I managed to find the love of my life. She is a powerhouse of
        a woman, and is my favorite person in the whole wide world. Shes a graphic designer and owner of <a
            href="https://www.hustlingmami.com/">Hustling Mami</a>. She is head over heels for me as well and treats me
        better than anything i ever thought was possible. In all honesty, even while being heavily objective, we are by
        far the healthiest relationship I have ever witnessed. We have been engaged for a few months now and every day
        that passes, I am more and more in love! She is my best friend. I cant wait to land a good career in tech and
        make some apps of my own that blows up, so we can travel together and pop out a bunch of little rock stars. Here
        is some places we would like to travel.
    <div>
        <h3>Travel Spots</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Greece
            <li>Japan
            <li>Egypt
            <li>Puerto Rico</li>
            </li>
            </li>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    And the list goes on and on.

    <h1 class="header">He's A Nerd!!!</h1>
    <p> Ya boy loves anime and video games, reading manga, larping, you name it! Thankfully due to my wit , humor and
        unrivaled charisma, I have been always able to also hang with the cool kids, but my heart was always with the
        nerds.
        Plus one of my biggest hobbies was always boxing and MMA, so no one had the stones to pick on me. But going back
        to
        some interests, heres a list of some of my favorite things!
