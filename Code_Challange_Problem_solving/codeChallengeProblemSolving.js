// To solve this problem,  If else statements can be aplied as well as putting each word of the paragraph into an array of stings. creating a for loop that runs through each word and checks it using the conditions of the if else statements to confirm if its first second or third person
//var arr = []
//for (var i = 0; i < arr.length(); i++) {
    //if (arr[i] == firstPerson) {
        //console.log("First Person");
   // } else if (arr[i] == secondPerson); {
       // console.log("Second person");
   // } else( arr[i] == thirdPerson);{
        //console.log("Third person");
    //}
   // }

   // I would say the hardest part is knowing exactly what tools in coding coorespond to the actions you are trying to execute.
